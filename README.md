## Project Architecture ðŸ“‚

- **hello-spring-greeting**
  - Simple Spring application demonstrating XML-based configuration
  - Shows basic IoC (Inversion of Control) and DI (Dependency Injection)

   -  Demonstrates Spring's XML-based DI with `Employee`-`Department` relationship.
   -  Uses `spring.xml` for bean definitions with setter injection (primitives) and reference injection (objects).

- **book-management-system-with-spring**
  - Added `AdminController` with register, login, and show all admins functionality using setter-based DI in Spring.
  - Demonstrates Spring's IoC and DI for admin management using XML-based configuration.

    - Registering a new admin with admin name, username, and password.
